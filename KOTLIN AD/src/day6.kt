Kotlin Conditions and If..Else
You already know that Kotlin supports familiar comparison conditions from mathematics, such as:

Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b
Equal to a == b
Not Equal to: a != b
You can use these conditions to perform different actions for different decisions.

Kotlin has the following conditionals:

Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
Use when to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
Note: Unlike Java, if..else can be used as a statement or as an expression (to assign a value to a variable) in Kotlin. See an example at the bottom of the page to better understand it.
